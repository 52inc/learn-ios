Let's Learn iOS
=========

Learn iOS from the ground up. Starting with the basics, the team at 52inc will take you from iOS novice to expert in no time. We'll begin with the fundamentals of Objective-C and guide you through the ins and outs of the platform. Then we’ll move on to learning UIKit, Core Animation, Quartz, and networking. Watch as we break down all the tricks your favorite apps use and show you how to create amazing user experiences in your apps.

Every week we’ll release a new video showing you how to accomplish something great in iOS, with each episode building on the last. At the end of every month we'll all gather to build a group project that uses everything you’ve learned in the videos. Ask questions and get answers from professional iOS developers and designers while learning about what everyone else is building in Columbia.

Whether you're just starting out or already know some Objective-C, together we’ll learn how to make great iOS apps that will wow your users. We invite you to join us each week online starting Monday, June 16th 2014 at [52inc.co/learn-ios](http://52inc.co/learn-ios). Join us at [IT-oLogy](http://it-ology.org) in Columbia for our first meetup event on Tuesday, July 8th 2014 from 6:00pm-8:00pm and again on the second Tuesday of each month.
